		<p class="para">Brooklyn has the decreased number of domestic violence victims in 2018 compared to it's 2013, and experts say that we might face a result of whole commuities' years of work.
		</p>

		<p class="para"><a href="https://16dayscampaign.org/">16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence(GBV)</a>, New York City's campaign for rooting out domestic violence, observed its last 16th day on Dec. 10, 2019. In September of 2018, Mayor Bill de Blasio initiated the Mayor’s Office to Combat Domestic Violence and the mayor's office to End Domestic and Gender-Biasd Violence (ENDGBV) to accelerate the New York City’s strategic response to domestic violence. Now the city is on the last moment of its 2019, and <a href="https://www.criminaljustice.ny.gov/crimnet/ojsa/domestic-violence-data.html">New York State's data</a> indicates that Brooklyn shows the best result of the city's effort.
		</p>

		<p>"Now New York City has a bunch of resources to educate communities about family violence and help domestic violence victims. I think that makes slow but firm effect on domestic violence in the city," said Elian Diaz, a domestic violence associate working with Safe Horizon.

		<p class="captions">The map shows the location of the domestic violecne program working with ENDGBV, and how 2018's number of domestic violence vitim is different from 2013's. The darker color, the more increased number of victims. The map was made out from <a href="diary/Koo_DV_diary.docx">Division of Criminal Justice Services's reports in 2013, and 2018, and NYC open data</a>.
		</p>

		<p class="para">New York States' data show that the number of domestic violence victims are averagely 7% increased around the city, but only Brooklyn recorded 4% decrease of the number of domestic violence victims in 2018 compared to 2013. Dr. Christopher Herrmann, a specialist of crime statistic at John Jay College, said, "It's difficult to say what triggered the decrease from the data, but the 4% decrease is meaningful when the average is the 7% increase."
		</p>

		<p>"I haven't tracked the data in NYC, but it's great," said Prof. Julie Goldscheid, an expert of domestic violence at CUNY lawschool. She also couldn't give a firm explanation how the number of the victims in brooklyn goes down. However, she made it clear that not only appropriate laws but also people's supportive attitude to endorse equivalent partnerships are critical to stop domestic violence through her work.

		<p>Brooklyn community district 10, which contains Bay Ridge and Dyker Heights, shows the lowest number of family-related domestic incident in 2018 according to <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/ocdv/downloads/pdf/ENDGBV_Family%20Related%20Violence%20Community%20Board%20Snapshots_2018.pdf">ENDGBV's report</a>. Officer Porcello at NYPD's 68th precint, which is geographically responsible to Bay Ridge area, said that eradicating domestic violence can be succeed only if the government, law enforcement, local precincts, and community members are all active to prevent domestic violence. "I think this number came out from the whole community's cooperation."
